/**
398. Random Pick Index


Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 */
var Solution = function(nums) {
    const cache = {};
    nums.map( (item, index) => {
        cache[item] = cache[item] || [];
        cache[item].push( index );
    });
    this.cache = cache;
};

/** 
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
Solution.prototype.pick = function(target) {
    const arr = this.cache[target];
    const ran = arr[ Math.floor( Math.random() * arr.length ) ];
    return ran;
};

/** 
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new Solution(nums)
