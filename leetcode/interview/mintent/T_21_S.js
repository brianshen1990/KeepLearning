/**
 * Question 21
 * 
 * A development team wants to have a process for continuous integration and delivery which doesn't risk having different builds for the development and production environments. Tha main issue is the possibility that a new commit will be added to the development branch after merging, but before the build phase for either branch has started. 
 * 
 * Select preferred steps to satisfy the requirement:
 * 
 * 1 Deny changes to repository while the production and development branches are merged and an executable is built.
 * 2 √ The CD pipeline can have a different configuration for each environment.
 * 3 After deployment, manually trigger an automation script to update the configuration per environment.
 * 4 Create a separate CI pipeline for the production environment. 
 * 5 √ Build artifacts once for both environments and reuse the CD pipeline.
 * 6 Unify the development and production branches into one, while feature/bug-fixes branches can still be used.
