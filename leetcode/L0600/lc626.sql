/**
626. Exchange Seats

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

/* Write your MySQL query statement below */

select if(id = (select count(*) from seat ) and (select count(*) from seat ) mod 2 = 1, id, if( id mod 2 = 1, id+1, id-1 ) )  as id ,
student from seat order by id

/*
{"headers": {"seat": ["id","student"]}, "rows": {"seat": [[1,"Abbot"],[2,"Doris"],[3,"Emerson"],[4,"Green"],[5,"Jeames"]]}}
{"headers": {"seat": ["id","student"]}, "rows": {"seat": [[1,"Abbot"],[2,"Doris"],[3,"Emerson"],[4,"Green"],[5,"Jeames"],[6,"MM"]]}}
